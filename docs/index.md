# Technical Authoring

Documentation is an important part of any software project. It helps your team to arrive at a common understanding of their tool, helps to sell the tool to potential customers, and helps new developers to extend, improve and use your tool. 

This set of Github pages has two complementary functions: 

* To discuss technical writing in general, and promote good writing processes and practices. 
* To try out some technical writing stuff, testing new or different ways of approaching technical writing projects.

## Why do these pages exist? 

Well, they have been created to make use of Github pages to host some content for me for free! This great facility lets me have a small platform to talk about my role and to share some of my experience with others. 

It also provides a space where I can work with Markdown and Github pages to show some samples of my working and my thinking and to give people an idea as to why I have become not just a technical author, but a technical writing evangelist!

I hope you find these pages illuminating.
