# Autoplay Videos

By default, **AUTOPLAY** automatically starts the next video that is lined up for you in your **Up next** column when the video you are watching ends.

The next video does not start playing immediately. It is loaded into the main window, and a 10 second countdown is started. 
* If you do nothing, the video starts after 10 seconds. 
* If you click the **Play** icon, the video starts immediately. 
* If you click **CANCEL**, the video does not start and the countdown ends. 

## Turn off Autoplay

If you do not want the next video to start automatically, then you can turn off autoplay in the top right-hand corner. 

### PC (Default if Opened on PC)

* Toggle the *Autoplay* option above the **Up next** column.   

*Fig 1: Autoplay Toggle (Autoplay is OFF)*

This turns off Autoplay. Autoplay is not limited to this session, and will remain off until you use the same widget to turn it back on. 

### Mobile

### TV Box 

## Additional Items and Comments

* There should also be a "Turn On Autoplay" topic.
* Depending on the scope of configuration available, there may also be one or more configuration options. (For example, you may not want to see a 10 second countdown.)
* If there is a troubleshooting section, it could include: 
  * "My Video Does Not Start Automatically"
  * "I want to Stop Videos Starting Automatically"
* I would also add a link to a topic "How does Autoplay Select the next Video to play?"
* I would also recommend a "How to" pop-up telling users to switch this on / off if they would like to use it.
