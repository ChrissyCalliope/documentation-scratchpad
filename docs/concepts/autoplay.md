# Autoplay Videos

By default, **AUTOPLAY** automatically starts the next video for you when the video you are watching ends. The next video for you is at the top of your **Up next** column, to the right of your player window.  

The next video does not start playing immediately. It is loaded into the player window, and a 10 second countdown is started. 
* If you do nothing, the video starts after the 10 seconds are up. 
* If you click the **Play** icon, the video starts immediately. 
* If you click **CANCEL**, the video does not start and the countdown ends. 

## Turn off Autoplay

If you do not want the next video to start automatically, then you can turn off autoplay in the top right-hand corner. 

### PC (Default if Opened on PC)

* Toggle the *Autoplay* option above the **Up next** column.

This turns off Autoplay. Your autoplay setting is not limited to this session. Autoplay will remain off until you use the same widget to turn it back on.
