# Auto-Play Videos

By default, auto-play automatically starts the next video that is lined up for you in your **Up next** column when the video you are watching ends.

The next video does not start playing immediately. It is loaded into the main window, and a 10 second countdown is started. 

* If you do nothing, the video starts after 10 seconds. 
* If you click the **Play** icon, the video starts immediately. 
* If you click **Cancel**, the video is does not start and the countdown ends. 

## Turn off Auto-Play

If you do not want the next video to start automatically, then you can turn off auto-play in the top right-hand corner. 

### PC (Default if Opened on PC)

* Toggle the *Auto-Play* option above the **Up next** column.   

*Fig 1: Auto-Play Toggle (Auto-Play is OFF)*

This turns off Auto-Play. Auto-Play is not limited to one visit to the website, and will remain off until you use the same widget to turn it back on.

### Mobile

### TV Box 

## Additional Items and Comments

* There should also be a "Turn On Auto-Play" topic.
* Depending on the scope of configuration available, there may also be one or more configuration options. (For example, you may not want to see a 10 second countdown.)
* If there is a troubleshooting section, it could include: 
  * "My Video Does Not Start Automatically"
  * "I want to Stop Videos Starting Automatically"
  * "How does Auto-Play Select the next Video to play?"
* I would also recommend a "How to" pop-up telling users to switch this on / off if they would like to use it.
