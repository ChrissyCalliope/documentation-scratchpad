# Autoplay Videos

By default, **AUTOPLAY** automatically starts the next video for you when the video you are watching ends. The next video for you is the one at the top of your **Up next** column, to the right of your player window.  

Typically, the next video does not start playing immediately. It is loaded into the player window, and a countdown begins that indicates when the next video will start. 
* If you do nothing, the video starts after the countdown is up (by default, this is after 10 seconds). 
* If you click the **Play** icon at any time, the countdown is skipped and the video starts immediately. 
* If you click **CANCEL**, the video does not start and the countdown also ends. 

## Turn off Autoplay

If you do not want the next video to start automatically, then you can turn off autoplay in the top right-hand corner. 

### Tabs: PC | <span color="#CCCCCC">Mobile | TV</span>

* Toggle the *Autoplay* option above the **Up next** column.   

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ![Autoplay Toggle - Off](../images/autoplay.png)

This turns off Autoplay. Your autoplay setting is not limited to this session, and will remain off until you use the same widget to turn it back on. 

**Note:** Autoplay will not continue indefinitely on Wifi. Autoplay will time out (videos will cease to automatically start) after 4 hours of inactivity.  

## Additional Items and Comments

* There should also be a "Turn On Autoplay" topic.
* Depending on the scope of configuration available, there may also be one or more configuration options that can be set by the user. 
* If there is a troubleshooting section, it should include: 
  * My Video Does Not Start Automatically
  * I want to Stop Videos Starting Automatically
* It would be good to add a link to this topic: How does Autoplay Select the next Video to play?
* I also recommend creating a "How to" pop-up, telling users to switch this on / off if they would like to use it.  
* Reader: User, Sales representative, Tester and developer (if this content is produced as part of the design for the functionality and only becomes its post creation description after it is developed).
