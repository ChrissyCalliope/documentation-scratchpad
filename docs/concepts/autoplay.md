# Autoplay Videos

By default, **AUTOPLAY** automatically starts the next video for you when the video you are watching ends. The next video for you is the one at the top of your **Up next** column, to the right of your player window.  

Typically, the next video does not start playing immediately. It is loaded into the player window, and a ountdown is started. 
* If you do nothing, the video starts after the countdown is up (by default this period is 10 seconds). 
* If you click the **Play** icon, the countdown is skipped and the video starts immediately. 
* If you click **CANCEL**, the video does not start and the countdown also ends. 

## Turn off Autoplay

If you do not want the next video to start automatically, then you can turn off autoplay in the top right-hand corner. 

### PC (Default if Opened on PC)

* Toggle the *Autoplay* option above the **Up next** column.

**Note:** Autoplay will not continue indefinitely on Wifi. It will time out after 4 hours of inactivity.
