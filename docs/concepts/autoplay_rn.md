# New and Modified Features: Autoplay

When a new release is made, it is necessary to communicate what the new features are, and why users might want to make use of them. This is usually done through a release notes document or new features popups. These popups are typically messages that open unprompted in a dialogue box during the installation or on opening the tool after an upgrade. 

## Autoplay Videos

**AUTOPLAY** automatically starts the next video for you when the video you have been watching ends. The next video for you is the one at the top of your **Up next** column, to the right of your player window.

Your users can: 
* Benefit from autoplay without making any changes. By default, autoplay is now enabled and most users will benefit from it straight away. 
* Switch autoplay off and on in their browser according to their needs.
* Configure the countdown period between the end of one video and the start of the next. 
* Use the Autoplay API endpoints to make changes programmatically.
